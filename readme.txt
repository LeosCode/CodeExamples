This directory is for those who want to know if I can code. I primarily code in C. I can read and maintain C++. I have used several other programming languages and refresh when I need to use them again.

These directories contain code examples from coding exams.

If you want me to take a coding test with your problem then let me know by sending it to me. I will answer the problem and post it here.
