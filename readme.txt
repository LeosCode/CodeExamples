This directory is for those who want to know if I can code. I primarily code in C. I can read and maintain C++ but I'm not an Object Oriented Designer so I don't consider myself a C++ programmer. I have used several programming languages and have to refresh when I need to use them again.

These directories contain code examples. Some of these are from companies that I did coding exams. Some are from standardized coding tests.

If you want me to take a coding test with your problem then let me know by sending it to me. I will answer the problem and post it here.
